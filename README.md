# dahliaOS Wallpapers
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dahliaos/wallpapers?color=brightgreen)

 - Official and community-made wallpapers for dahliaOS
 - All community designs must follow the design guidelines written below
 - With designer's consent, we might pick some community wallpapers and make them dahliaOS official ones if we like them

## Design guidelines

* Every submitted wallpaper must be in both PNG/JPEG and SVG/RAW format
  * If you've submitted a photograph, you must provide raw image data instead of an SVG
  * Wallpapers should be atleast:
    * 3840x2160 pixels, not smaller than 1920x1080 pixels for desktops
    * 1440x2960 pixels, not smaller than 1080x1920 pixels for mobile
  * Optional: Upload the project file (.fig, .psd, .ai etc.)
    * Create a folder called after the project file extension where you created PNG/JPEG and SVG/RAW ones
* dahliaOS has two main colors, Deep Orange and Shallow Orange
  * Hex code for Deep Orange is #C00000
  * Hex code for Shallow Orange is #FF4300
* You can find dahliaOS/Pangolin logos right [here](https://github.com/dahliaos/brand)

## Important

* **Do not** publish a wallpaper you're not an owner of
* Licensed wallpapers are not accepted
* Make sure your SVG isn't rasterized (Photoshop users will understand)

## Contribute

3. In the community folder, depending on if your wallpaper/s is/are for desktops or mobile phones, inside the desktop/mobile folder, make your own folder and name it after your GitHub username
4. In the folder you just created, make two folders called PNG/JPEG and SVG/RAW
5. Put PNGs/JPEGs into the PNG/JPEG folder, SVGs/RAWs into the SVG/RAW folder
6. Open a pull request and fill in the template
